# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
In this project, we will explore the concepts of conditionals and loops. We will learn how to use if statements, if...else statements, as well as break, continue, and pass statements.
## Project Objectives
- Why indentation is so important in Python
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the while and for loops
- How is Python’s for different from C‘s?
- How to use the break and continues statements
- How to use else clauses on loops
- What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
- How to use range
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What does return a function that does not use any return statement
- Scope of variables
- What’s a traceback
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Mandatory tasks

> **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing:**
* Create a Python script that assigns a random signed number to the variable "number" every time it is executed. Then, print whether the value stored in "number" is positive or negative. 

> **1. The last digit:**
* Create a Python script that assigns a random signed number to the variable "number" every time it is executed. Then, print the last digit the number stored in "number" 

> **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game:**
* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
* Using only one print and one loop.
* Storing characters in variables or importing modules not allowed.

> **3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off:**
* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
* Print all the letters except q and e
* Use one print function with string format and one loop
* Store characters in a variable or importing any module are not allowed

> **4. Hexadecimal printing:**
* Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
* Use one loop and print function with string format.
* Storing numbers or strings in a variable or importing any module are not allowed.

> **5. 00...99**
* Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
* Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space and printed in ascending order, with two digits.
* The last number should be followed by a new line.
* Use a single loop and limit the use of print functions with string formatting to two.
* Storing numbers or strings in a variable or importing any module are not allowed.

> **6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need:**
* Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
* Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space and the two digits must be different.
* 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1.
* Print only the smallest combination of two digits.
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
* The last number should be followed by a new line
*  Only two loops and limits the use of print functions to three
*  Storing numbers or strings in a variable or importing any module are not allowed.

> **7. islower:**
* Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
* Prototype: def islower(c):
* Returns True if c is lowercase, otherwise false.
* Not allowed to import any module and use str.upper() and str.isupper()
